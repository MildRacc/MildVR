## 10/28/2025 - Electronics Research  

Because I want my headset to be a wireless PCVR headset, I need to transmit and receive data incredibly fast. DisplayPort 1.2 transmits 21.6 Gib/s, and I'd like each eye to be about 2k120fps. I found WiGig transceivers to be the best option for this, and the particular models I'm going to use are the [HMC6300/6301](https://www.mouser.com/c/?marcom=138219097) chips.

I need to have a chip to decode and encode DisplayPort data going to and fro the transmitter and receiver, and the [ANX7497](https://www.analogix.com/en/products/re-timersrepeaters/anx7497) seems to be the best option for what I need. It can also compress and decompress DisplayPort data, making video transmission faster, and less of a hassle.

For the displays, I have a lot of options. All I want is 2k120fps. A lot of companies sell displays catered to VR/AR on sites like Alibaba and Aliexpress, and I have found tons of displays that meet my needs.

For the inside-out tracking, I plan to use a dual [OV9281](https://docs.arducam.com/Raspberry-Pi-Camera/Native-camera/Global-Shutter/1MP-OV9281-OV9282/) setup mounted into the front of the headset. In the controllers I will have an array of NIR (Near-Infrared) LEDs in a configuration similar to that of the Oculus Rift S controllers. The purpose of these NIR LEDs is to give the cameras points to track, and by arranging them in a certain configuration will allow me to determine the transform of the entire controller.

This image shows the LED configuration of the original Oculus Rift. Having a recognizable LED configuration makes tracking more precise.

The controllers and headset will all contain two [BMI270](https://www.mouser.com/new/bosch/bosch-sensortec-bmi270/) IMUs. The purpose of having two IMUs is for redundancy, reliability, noise reduction, and improved orientation tracking. Oculus and other high-end controllers typically use a single IMU in their controllers, but due to the fact that my inside-out tracking algorithms are likely not going to be on-par with theirs, I feel it is necessary to compensate by making IMU readings more accurate.
