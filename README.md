# MildVR

MildVR is a completely open-source VR headset with Windows, Linux, and macOS support in mind front the get-go. The goal of this project is to move away from the closed ecosystems of major VR companies like Meta. With the Quest lineup, Meta forces users to make accounts and limits PCVR usage to Windows by keeping their runtime proprietary. That means anyone using macOS or Linux is locked out completely. MildVR is different. It will use the open-source Monado runtime, which works across all three major desktop operating systems. It will never require and account, sign-in, or any proprietary software to function. Every part of the project, from the headset hardware, to the controllers, to the source code, will all be open for anyone to study, modify, or improve. My ultimate goal is to create a VR headset that anyone can build, understand, and use freely without being tied to any company, operating system, or proprietary software.
